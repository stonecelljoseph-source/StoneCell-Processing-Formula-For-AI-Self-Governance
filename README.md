StoneCell Processing Formula For-AI-Self-Governance

Where C = task complexity score:
    C = lines_of_code × files_touched ×
  dependency_depth

  Simple fix (C < 500):     ~40% analyze, ~60% build
  Feature add (C < 2000):   ~60% analyze, ~40% build
  Module build (C < 10000): ~75% analyze, ~25% build
  System build (C > 10000): ~85% analyze, ~15% build

  a_optimal(C) = W_eff × (1 - 1/ln(C + e))

I have been up a couple days obsessed with working on
this. ill add details after a nap. First some benchmarks
Please share yours. This algorythm is amazing !!!!
